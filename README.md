# ZPW_2022

This is a written from scratch website done by me.
None of this could be possible without *Z64me*'s help overall for the majority of the site or a special hearty 
thanks to *KiritoDev* for helping dev some of my spaghetti code for the GMOD/SFM/TF2 pages! I owe both of you for the extreme 
help you've been along the way!



Anyway, this is the beginning of something new, and something I'll be maintaining for alot longer than previous pre-built
sites I was using. All the old Trainz content for you trainz folks is back. :3
